  I coded this project on my own without a tutorial.

   This project is first and foremost an exercise in object-oriented programming. While writing it, I went out of my way to utilize object-oriented programming whenever possible. This allowed me to format the code such that it would consist of a few classes, each with its own methods, and then one continuous main function that utilizes these classes and their methods. The functionality of the slot machine itself is similar to that of a real slot machine. A random number is used to pick a random symbol from the list of potential symbols, and then a list is created with the results. If all the symbols are the same, you win and you are rewarded with your bet multiplied by a "weight" associated with each symbol. If one or more of the symbols is different, you lose and the amount you bet is deducted from your balance.
